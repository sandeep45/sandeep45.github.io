# Web Server

This is my new favorite way to pop up a webserver whereever I want it.

```
  cd wherever
  python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

I use it when building standalone javascript apps, cloning and debugging a page locally etc.
Its solves the cross domain error one would get when running a HTML/JS app and making server call
